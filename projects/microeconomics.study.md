**microeconomics.study** is a simple website I built to help me do well on exams
for
[ECON208](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/courses/econ-208){target="\_blank"},
an entry level microeconomics course taught at
[McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/){target="\_blank"}

With the course evaluations being primarily multiple-choice exams of varying
length, drilling a bunch of problems is the key to do well on them.

The site offers a nice web interface around a categorized problem bank, with a
few other nice features like question navigation, exam simulation, and live
feedback.
