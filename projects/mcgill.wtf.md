**mcgill.wtf** is a fast full-text search of McGill's entire course catalog with
a server implemented in Rust and an intuitive front-end built using React.

I was inspired to build this after seeing
[classes.wtf](https://classes.wtf/){target="\_blank"}, a super fast course
search engine for Harvard's course catalog implemented by
[Eric Zhang](https://www.ekzhang.com/){target="\_blank"} - in addition to
noticing a need for this considering McGill's lack of full-text course search
infrastructure.
