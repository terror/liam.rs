**chatgpt-euler** was an experiment to see how good the initial ChatGPT
(GPT-3.5) language model was at solving and explaining problems you can find on
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/){target="\_blank"}.

It turns out not too bad for the first ~100 problems or so. This was a fun
experiment to try out.
