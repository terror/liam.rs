**crisp** is a lisp written in C with a web playground compiled using
[WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly?useskin=vector){target="\_blank"}.
I wrote it initially to get more familiar with C using the book
[Build Your Own Lisp](https://buildyourownlisp.com/){target="\_blank"} by Daniel
Holden as a rough guide to follow.
