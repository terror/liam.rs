**solve** is an interface for spinning up competitive programming workspaces
quickly.

It allows for users to solve problems on various contest platforms, testing and
submitting code directly from a single environment - in addition to letting you
save these environments for later.

Code execution against sample test cases is handled by
[judge0](https://judge0.com/){target="\_blank"} cloud.
