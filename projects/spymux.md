**spymux** is a terminal user-interface for simultaneously watching all of your
open [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux){target="\_blank"} panes.

I pair program a fair amount with tools like
[codex](https://github.com/openai/codex){target="\_blank"}, and I run them in
different projects (windows) at the same time. So I built this tool to give me a
clear view into what the agents are doing, without having to switch between
them.
