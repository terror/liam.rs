**pqg** is a tool designed to help users generate synthetic pandas queries for
training machine learning models that estimate query execution costs or predict
cardinality.

I wrote this as part of a
[research course](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/courses/comp-400) I took
at McGill University, under the supervision of professor
[Bettina Kemme](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/) with the
[Distributed Information Systems Lab](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~kemme/disl/index.html)
(DISL).
