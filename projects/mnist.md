**mnist** is a neural network written from scratch with the goal of being able to
recognize handwritten digits, written in pure Rust with minimal dependencies used
in the training process.

You're able to train and make predictions directly from the CLI. There's also
a subcommand to spawn an interactive GUI application where you can draw digits
and have it perform live inference of the drawn figure.
