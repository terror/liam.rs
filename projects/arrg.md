**arrg** is a Python library for building modular command-line applications
using a declarative, class-based approach.

It leverages Python type hints and decorators to simplify the creation of
complex command-line interfaces with arguments and subcommands, while
maintaining compatibility with the standard
[argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html){target="\_blank"}
library.
