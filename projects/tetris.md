This was my first foray into 'real' game programming, among other things the
project includes:

- [A state machine](https://github.com/terror/tetris/tree/master/src/states){target="\_blank"}
- [Dynamic sprite loading](https://github.com/terror/tetris/blob/master/lib/SpriteManager.js){target="\_blank"}
- [Sounds](https://github.com/terror/tetris/blob/master/lib/Sounds.js){target="\_blank"}
- [High-score management](https://github.com/terror/tetris/blob/master/src/states/EnterHighScoreState.js){target="\_blank"}
- [Saved states](https://github.com/terror/tetris/blob/master/lib/StateManager.js){target="\_blank"}
- [Game progression with levels](https://github.com/terror/tetris/blob/master/src/states/LevelTransitionState.js){target="\_blank"}

I wrote this as a final project for a
[game programming course](https://jac-cs-game-programming-fall22.github.io/Notes/#/){target="\_blank"}
I took at [John Abbott College](https://johnabbott.qc.ca/){target="\_blank"}
taught by [Vikram Singh](https://github.com/VikramSinghMTL){target="\_blank"} in
my 5th semester.
