**pdfathom** is a command-line utility that lets you query PDF documents with
natural language.

It lets you easily spawn a conversational repl environment with PDF documents on
disk or in the cloud - building an in-memory question-answering agent with
[OpenAI embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) and
[LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) as
the orchestrator.
