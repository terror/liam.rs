**swab** is a configurable project cleaning tool.

I wrote this because other similar projects either weren't configurable enough
(didn't allow adding custom rules without submitting a PR) or flexible enough
(no glob support) to fit some of my use cases.

The tool is very simple at its core, providing users with a set of default rules
and the building blocks to override them or create new ones.
