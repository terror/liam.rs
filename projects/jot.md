**jot** is a developer-focused daily note-taking application.

It providers users with a new persisted text buffer each day.

Built on top of the [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/docs){target="\_blank"} text
editor, it offers fully inline markdown and math (with LaTeX) rendering.

**jot** is built using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/){target="\_blank"}, with Rust
for the 'backend', and React/TypeScript on the frontend.
