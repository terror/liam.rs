**jot** is a text editor for the day.

The application is centered around a day, maintaining a set of markdown files on
disk for each one.

It's a place to store your ephemeral notes, thoughts, and the like you have
throughout the day. Think of it as a 'journal' separate from your primary
editor.

**jot** is built using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/){target="\_blank"}, with Rust
for the 'backend', and React/TypeScript on the frontend.

[Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/docs){target="\_blank"} is used for text editor
implementation, allowing for a few niceties such as inline markdown and math
rendering, search and replace, inline menu, etc.
