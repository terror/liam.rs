**val** is a bc-inspired arbitrary precision calculator language.

It aims to approximate much of the functionality described in the
[bc(1) man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bc), but also differing in
syntax/semantics to make the language more convenient to write.

You can use **val** from the provided command-line, library or web playground
interfaces.
