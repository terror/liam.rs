I was an early contributor to **ord**, the index, block explorer, and
command-line wallet for
[ordinals](https://github.com/ordinals/ord/blob/master/bip.mediawiki){target="\_blank"} -
the brain-child of [Casey Rodarmor](https://rodarmor.com/){target="\_blank"}.

Ordinals are a numbering scheme for satoshis that allows tracking and
transferring individual sats.

The work I did on **ord** was primarily focused on the block explorer and
building out an initial wallet prototype to facilitate ordinal-aware
transactions.
