I wrote **stream** as a way to post short snippets of text to a feed that isn't
crowded by noise and ads (cough Twitter).

It offers a few other niceties:

- Authentication with GitHub
- Post creation form with live markdown preview
- Custom markdown renderer with syntax highlighting and math typesetting with
  KaTeX
- Fast full-text search through the entire feed
- Tag support with exact tag search - simply prefix queries with `#`

And it's easily self-hostable with
[docker](https://github.com/terror/stream/blob/master/Dockerfile){target="\_blank"}.
