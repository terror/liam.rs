**mem1p** is a tool that let's you memorize new or existing passphrases easily.

It leverages [Web-LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm) and
[Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-stable-diffusion) running on
chromes recently shipped
[WebGPU](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/webgpu-release/) to generate
memorable sentences and images that help you better contextualize your
passphrase.

This project was built during an internal hackathon with a few colleagues at
[1Password](https://1password.com/) during my Summer 2023 internship.
