**hush** is a browser extension that lets you easily convert speech to text,
powered by [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper){target="\_blank"} and
[WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API){target="\_blank"}.

I couldn't find a simple, easy to use speech to text extension for the browser
that leverages WebGPU instead of querying some cloud based model, so I built
one.

The main features are recording speech into text from the popup view, and
spinning up a recording session from any text field on the page via a hotkey.
