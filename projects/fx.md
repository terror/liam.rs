**fx** is a simple command-based language for producing art based on texture
input/output chaining.

This was a side experiment done before implementing GPU acceleration for
[degenerate](https://github.com/casey/degenerate){target="\_blank"}, mostly as a
way to fledge out the chaining technique with
[WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API){target="\_blank"}
textures.
