**breakout** is a simple clone of the popular arcade video game developed and
published by Atari - Breakout.

It's a rudimentary clone that simply keeps track of a score and live count, with
some basic sound effects to go along with the gameplay.

I wrote this as a final project for a basic web programming course I took at
[John Abbott College](https://johnabbott.qc.ca/) taught by Helen Katalifos in my
3rd semester.
